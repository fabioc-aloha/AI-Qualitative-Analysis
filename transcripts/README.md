# transcripts/

This folder is for your input transcript files. Place each interview, focus group, or open-ended survey response here as a plain text (`.txt`) file. Each file should be clearly named to reflect its content or source (e.g., `CustomerA_Interview.txt`).

**Guidelines:**
- Use plain text format (`.txt`).
- Clearly indicate speakers in the transcript for best results (e.g., `Interviewer:`, `Customer:`).
- Remove or redact any sensitive or confidential information before processing.
- You can process multiple transcripts in a batch; each will generate a separate report.

> This folder is user-maintained. Only place files here that you want analyzed. Processed transcripts are not modified or deleted by the tool.

**Privacy Note:**
- This folder is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental publishing of PII or sensitive data. Always verify your `.gitignore` settings before sharing or publishing this repository.
