# reports/

This folder contains all output generated by the analysis pipeline. For each transcript processed, you will find:

- **Markdown Report (`*_analysis.md`)**: The main structured analysis in Markdown format, suitable for review and further editing.
- **Word Report (`*_analysis.docx`)**: The same analysis, converted to Microsoft Word format for easy sharing.
- **LLM Validation Feedback (`*_llm_validation.md`)**: A Markdown file containing the results of the LLM's self-validation step for each transcript, including any issues found and how they were addressed.
- **Actual Prompts Used**: For each transcript and each step (initial, validation, revision), the exact prompts sent to the LLM (with all variables filled in) are saved here for transparency, troubleshooting, and auditability.

**Guidelines:**
- This folder is user-maintained for output only. You may delete or archive reports as needed.
- Do not place input transcripts here; use the `transcripts/` folder for input files.
- Review the validation feedback and actual prompts if you need to troubleshoot or audit the analysis process.

> All output is organized by transcript name for easy traceability.

**Privacy Note:**
- This folder is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental publishing of PII or sensitive data. Always verify your `.gitignore` settings before sharing or publishing this repository.
